<h1>CI/CD pipeline</h1>

<h3>Term</h3>

* The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
    * CI => Continuous Integration
    * CD => Continuous Delivery & Deployment


<h3>Continuous integration</h3>
Continuous Integration is a way for software project programmers to integrate their code into a version control system. The way of working also includes unit testing of the code.

<h3>Continuous Deployment</h3>
Continuous deployment (CD) mean the automatic releasing of changes made by the developers, from the development version to production, where it is available to customers.

<h3>Workflow</h3>

1. To add CI/CD pipeline to your project, create a ```.github/workflows/``` folder at the root of the project.
2. Create ```BuildAndDeploy.yml``` file in ```./.github/workflows```
3. Paste next code in the ```BuildAndDeploy.yml```

```yml
name: Build and Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1

      - name: Install and Build üîß # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the 'build' folder. Replace with the commands required to build your project, or remove this step entirely if your site is pre-built.
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - name: Deploy üöÄ
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.3
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: build # The folder the action should deploy.
```

The part ```on: [push]``` means, when you push your code changes next time, GitHub will run these jobs in actions. If these jobs succeed, this script create a new branch ```gh-pages``` in your project repository, and deploy your build to GitHub pages. 
* ```gh-pages``` branch is build version of your project.
* Your project page is available in ```https://[YourGitHubName].github.io/[YourRepositoryName]```

<h3>Attention</h3>

* <b>When you push code changes first time, with this yml file, it can take up to hours before your gh pages are available.</b>
* If your repository name contains hyphen or possibly other special characters, your gh-pages will not work.
